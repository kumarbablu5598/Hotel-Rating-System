# Hotel-Rating-System
  ## Description:
The Hotel Rating and Review System is a microservices-based application developed using Java and Spring Boot. This project allows users to rate and review hotels, view ratings and reviews, and manage hotel information. The system will be designed to handle high traffic and provide a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform.
 ## Project Objectives:
  * User Management: Implement user registration, authentication, and authorization.
  * Hotel Management: Allow hotel owners to register and manage their hotel information.
  * Rating and Review Management: Enable users to rate and review hotels, and view other users' ratings and reviews.
  * Search and Filter: Provide search functionality to find hotels based on location, rating, and other criteria.
  * Microservices Architecture: Develop the application using a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.
  * API Gateway: Use an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices.
  * Database: Use a relational database for storing user, hotel, and review data.
  * Security: Implement security measures to protect user data and ensure secure communication between services.
  * Deployment: Deploy the application on a cloud platform for accessibility and scalability.
